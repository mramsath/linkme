Ayye, Don't mistake me for writing this,
But I don't understand the logic behind this, Could you please explain?

1. Aluthgama and Digana incident are organized by some extremists in your community targeting muslim's properties, lives and mosques, almost  more than 15 mosques were affected, so you still claim those incodents as effect to you and sinhalease community?

2. You asking all to boycott muslim's shops and products? Even though you are well educated you don't understand that boycott the local products going to affect only the local people who are all sri lankans(not only msulims) and the country?

3. But still If you are decided to do so, then you should even withdrew your degree and trainings you had because you studied in government university which are run by poepole funds which contains all sri lankan's tax money not only one communities money. 

4. You had training in Etisalat which belongs to Muslims in Dubai?

5. You fill the oil and petrol which are comes from Saudi and Middle east countries?
